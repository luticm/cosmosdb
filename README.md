# Azure Cosmos DB

A collection of Cosmos DB resources.

## My experience with Cosmos DB
In the past few years I've worked closely with Cosmos DB across different roles at Microsoft

- Support Escalation Engineer for Azure Rapid Response: dealing with largest Cosmos DB customers and deployments worldwide.
- Cosmos DB Technical Advisor for Azure Rapid Response: guide/advisory role for all Cosmos DB support engineers in ARR.
- Customer Engineer at FastTrack for Azure: helping customers to accelerate their projects into Azure.
- Cosmos DB/NoSQL Global Black Belt: technical experts who specialize in helping customers on their journey with Cosmos DB, helping to design new solutions,  overcome technical challenges and drive innovation.

With extensive experience working with Azure Cosmos DB and helped numerous organizations successfully implement this powerful database service, I intent to use this repository as a curated reference for others to learn and growth with the technology.
